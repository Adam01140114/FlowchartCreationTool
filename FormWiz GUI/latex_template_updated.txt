\textbf{Re: Demand for Payment}

\vspace{1em}

Dear [how_many_people_are_you_counter_suing_name_1],

\vspace{1em}

I am writing to formally demand payment in the amount of [how_much_are_you_counter_suing_for] for the following reasons:

[explain_why_they_owe_you_that_money]

\vspace{1em}

This amount remains unpaid despite previous attempts to resolve this matter amicably.

\vspace{1em}

Please remit payment in full by 14 days from the date of this letter. Payment can be made via cash, check, or bank transfer.

\vspace{1em}

If payment is not received by the stated deadline, I will have no choice but to pursue legal action in small claims court to recover the amount owed, along with any applicable court costs and fees.

\vspace{1em}

I hope we can resolve this matter promptly and avoid further escalation. Please feel free to contact me at [user_phone] or [user_email] if you have any questions or wish to discuss this matter further.

\vspace{1em}

Thank you for your immediate attention to this matter.

\vspace{1em}

Sincerely,\\[2em]
[user_fullname]
