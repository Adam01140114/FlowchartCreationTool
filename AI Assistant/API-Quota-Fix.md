# OpenAI API Quota Fix Guide

## The Problem
You're getting a 429 error: "Too Many Requests" or "You exceeded your current quota". This means you've either:
1. Used up your free trial credits
2. Hit your monthly spending limit
3. Need to add payment information

## Quick Solutions

### Option 1: Add Payment Method (Recommended)
1. Go to [OpenAI Billing](https://platform.openai.com/account/billing)
2. Add a credit card or payment method
3. Set a monthly spending limit (e.g., $5-10)
4. Your API will work immediately

### Option 2: Use Fallback Mode
The AI Assistant now has a built-in fallback mode that works without the API:
1. When you get the quota error, click "Yes, Use Basic Legal Guidance"
2. You'll get helpful legal information from the built-in knowledge base
3. No API costs, but responses are more limited

### Option 3: Wait for Reset
- Free trial credits reset monthly
- Check your usage at [OpenAI Usage](https://platform.openai.com/usage)
