This is our documentation file which documents how all our different features 
work in the FormWiz GUI tool. This document serves as a reference guide for 
understanding the functionality, behavior, and purpose of various features 
within the form builder system.

BIG PARAGRAPH QUESTIONS - LIMITS
================================================================================

When creating a big paragraph question in the FormWiz GUI tool, there are two 
different types of limits you can set:

1. MAX CHARACTER LIMIT (maxCharacterLimit)
   - This is a HARD LIMIT that physically prevents users from typing beyond 
     the specified number of characters.
   - Sets the maxlength attribute on the textarea element, which enforces a 
     hard cap on input.
   - Controls the character counter display (e.g., "150 / 200 characters").
   - Users cannot type more characters once they reach this limit.

2. PARAGRAPH LIMIT (paragraphLimit)
   - This is a SOFT LIMIT that does NOT prevent users from typing beyond the 
     specified number of characters.
   - When the text length exceeds this limit, it automatically creates and 
     checks a hidden checkbox with the id: textareaId + "_overlimit".
   - This hidden checkbox can be used for conditional logic (like PDF logic) 
     to trigger additional PDFs, warnings, or other conditional behavior.
   - Users can continue typing beyond this limit - it's used to trigger 
     behavior rather than block input.

EXAMPLE SCENARIO:
- Max Character Limit = 500: User cannot type more than 500 characters.
- Paragraph Limit = 300: User can type beyond 300 characters, but when they 
  do, a hidden checkbox is checked that can trigger additional PDFs, warnings, 
  or other conditional behavior.

In summary: Max Character Limit blocks input, while Paragraph Limit triggers 
conditional behavior without blocking.
